## 🤔 How it works
ClearChat transforms traditional messaging by embedding genuine emotions directly into every message. Users securely sign up and log in using Firebase Authentication, ensuring quick and reliable access. Real-time messages are stored with Firestore Database, guaranteeing immediate delivery and consistent availability among users.

As messages are created, ClearChat uses the [Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-family-expands/) library to perform real-time facial sentiment analysis via webcam, accurately capturing emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, frustration, etc. Built on Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, ClearChat offers a fast, intuitive, and visually appealing user interface, providing a seamless, authentic chat experience across all platforms.
